# Introduction

What is php-by-contract?
-----------------

php-by-contract strives to be a lightweight [`Design by Contract`](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract>) library for PHP which can be added with minimal changes
to any existing projects.
With Design by Contract you can enforce the object oriented structure of your code and secure the interaction of these
objects with one another.

# Deprecation

This repository is no longer under development nor is it maintained! If you want to use Design by contract have a look at [Doppelgaenger](https://github.com/appserver-io/doppelgaenger).
It will be maintained instead of this repository and additionally offers [AOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming) features as well.
